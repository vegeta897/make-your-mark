"make your mark"

Players spawn in a randomly generated world full of objects
Move around and interact/gather objects
Deltas stored on firebase
Goal of game is to leave evidence of your existence (marks) in the game world
More complicated "marks" require more complex interactions involving more objects
    That includes objects in inventory, and objects nearby (chain reactions?)

Player lives should be finite
    Need to keep making marks or you die
    No users/registration, persistence is done through localstorage
        Players can enter a name when they die?

De-incentive to picking up everything you can find
    More stuff carried = die faster?
    When you die, all your carried stuff goes back to original spots
    
Persistent "recipe" learning system that makes it easier to do things you've already done

Making marks causes surrounding ground area to colorize to player's color
    Better marks cause further/stronger spread
    
Players can set up "traps" that may have ill-effects on other players

Players can get bikes/skateboards to move faster

Metagame ideas:

    Theft? AI guards with deterministic routines based on global tick?
    Something on a sector by sector basis?
